# Banking-System

# Project Description: 
This project was part of The Sparks Internship Program for Web Development. This application is a basic banking system that allows money transfer from one client to another and it is hosted on webhost. The main functionality of the website is that the administrator chooses to transfer money from one client to another based on the sender's balance. If the sender's balance can support the amount of money intended to be transferred, the money will be successfully tranferred to the receiver. If not, the transaction won't be completed. Finally, a table of all the previously made trasnactions is shown to the administrator.
